## Setup Instructions

2. **Configure Firebase:**

   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Firestore database (in test mode or with appropriate rules).
   - Get your Firebase config object from Project Settings.
   - Replace the `firebaseConfig` object in the HTML file with your own Firebase config credentials.

3. **Run the app:**

   - Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
   - Alternatively, serve it via a local web server (like `live-server` or VSCode Live Server) for best results.

## Usage

- Use the **Create New File** form to add a new contribution file by specifying a file name and date.
- The **Existing Files** list shows all contribution files with the date, total people count, and total contributed amount.
- Click on a file name to view and manage people contributions for that file.
- Add people by entering their name and amount, then clicking **Add**.
- Delete any file by clicking the red **Delete** button next to it (this action cannot be undone).
- Data updates live thanks to Firestoreâ€™s real-time sync.

## Notes

- Amounts are handled as decimals and displayed with two decimal places.
- Date inputs and displays use local timezone formatting.
- All data is stored and synced using Firestore, so internet access is required.
- Make sure your Firestore security rules are appropriate before using in production.
